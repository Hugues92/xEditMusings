Currently :
	- restore some action behind the ESMify autorun option.
	- compile xDump in 64 bits by default.
	- compile xEdit in LiteDebug by default.
	- restarted work on script ExportImportSVN.pas (following my Covid break from mod authoring :) ): 
		- WIP
		- The purpose is to export plugins (.es?) as text files so as to use source management tool to manage versions.
		- Import is mentioned , but, at this time, I do not pursue it any more (too complex for the time I have available).
