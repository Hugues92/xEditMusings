# xEditMusings
Various alternates to TES5Edit each looking at a different addition or change from the official repository. Some are totally obsolete in fact. None should be usable.

Trunk-uploaded-elminster-mine : 
	- My latest copy of the official repo, with very few changes today. 
	- Only differences with the official repo are stored.
	- This should be my "active" copy for things I do not intend to merge, at least soon.

Trunk-uploaded-elminster-mine-20240824 : 
	- How I left my developments around 2019/2020. 
	- Lots of incomplete and failed experiments.
	- Mostly decoding saves and dealing with compresses records and/or compressed files.
	- also differents versions of my script extenders plugins for various engine versions. Needs sorting out and cataloging.
	- Not merged with current official repo. Files limited to those I remember modifiying.
