# xEditMusings
Various alternates to TES5Edit each looking at a different addition or change from the official repository. Some are totally obsolete in fact. None should be usable.

Trunk-uploaded-elminster-mine : 
	- My latest copy of the official repo, with very few changes today. 
	- Only differences with the official repo are stored.
	- This should be my "active" copy for things I do not intend to merge, at least soon.
